# machineTranslation-Pytorch
A machine decoder-encoder translation RNN implemented in PyTorch.

This is based on the pytorch tutorial: <br>

I am trying to experiment with a convolutionalized attention RNN with this, but so far its not working well, and its buggy while using GPU (which I do not understand). To use the convolution attention RNN, checkout "testing", and go to the "attentionModel" folder.
